 * expression immediately; later, rules will transform it into relational expressions which can be implemented.
 *
 * If an abstract converter cannot be satisfied immediately (because the source subset is abstract), the set is flagged, so this converter will be expanded as soon as a non-abstract relexp is added to the set.</p>
