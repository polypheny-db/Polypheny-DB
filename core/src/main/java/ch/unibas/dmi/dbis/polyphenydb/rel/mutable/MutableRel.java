/**
 * Mutable equivalent of {@link RelNode}.
 *
 * Each node has mutable state, and keeps track of its parent and position within parent. It doesn't make sense to canonize {@code MutableRels},
 * otherwise one node could end up with multiple parents. It follows that {@code #hashCode} and {@code #equals} are less efficient
 * than their {@code RelNode} counterparts. But, you don't need to copy a {@code MutableRel} in order to change it.
 * For this reason, you should use {@code MutableRel} for short-lived operations, and transcribe back to {@code RelNode} when you are done.
