/**
 * Reference to a range of columns.

 * This construct is used only during the process of translating a {@link ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.polyphenydb.sql.SqlNode SQL} tree to a {@link ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.polyphenydb.rel.RelNode rel}/{@link RexNode rex} tree.
 * <em>Regular {@link RexNode rex} trees do not contain this construct.</em>
 *
 * While translating a join of EMP(EMPNO, ENAME, DEPTNO) to DEPT(DEPTNO2, DNAME) we create <code>RexRangeRef(DeptType,3)</code> to represent the pair of columns (DEPTNO2, DNAME) which came from DEPT.
 * The type has 2 columns, and therefore the range represents columns {3, 4} of the input.
 *
 * Suppose we later create a reference to the DNAME field of this RexRangeRef; it will return a <code>{@link RexInputRef}(5,Integer)</code>, and the {@link ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.polyphenydb.rex.RexRangeRef} will disappear.
