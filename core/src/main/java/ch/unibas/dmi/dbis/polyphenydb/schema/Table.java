/**
 * Table.
 *
 * The typical way for a table to be created is when Polypheny-DB interrogates a user-defined schema in order to validate names appearing in a SQL query.
 * Polypheny-DB finds the schema by calling {@link Schema#getSubSchema(String)} on the connection's root schema, then gets a table by calling {@link Schema#getTable(String)}.
 *
 * Note that a table does not know its name. It is in fact possible for a table to be used more than once, perhaps under multiple names or under multiple schemas.
 * (Compare with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">i-node</a> concept in the UNIX filesystem.)
 *
 * A particular table instance may also implement {@link Wrapper}, to give access to sub-objects.
