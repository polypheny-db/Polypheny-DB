/**
 * Extension to the {@link Schema} interface.
 *
 * Given a user-defined schema that implements the {@link Schema} interface, Polypheny-DB creates a wrapper that implements the {@code SchemaPlus} interface.
 * This provides extra functionality, such as access to tables that have been added explicitly.
 *
 * A user-defined schema does not need to implement this interface, but by the time a schema is passed to a method in a user-defined schema or user-defined table, it will have been wrapped in this interface.
 *
 * SchemaPlus is intended to be used by users but not instantiated by them.
 * Users should only use the SchemaPlus they are given by the system.
 * The purpose of SchemaPlus is to expose to user code, in a read only manner, some of the extra information about schemas that Polypheny-DB builds up when a schema is registered.
 * It appears in several SPI calls as context; for example {@link SchemaFactory#create(SchemaPlus, String, java.util.Map)} contains a parent schema that might be a wrapped instance of a user-defined {@link Schema}, or indeed might not.
