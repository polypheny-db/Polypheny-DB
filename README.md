# Polypheny-DB

_Polypheny-DB_ is a self-adaptive Polystore that provides cost- and workload aware access to heterogeneous data.  

Polypheny-DB is a research system developed at the University of Basel, Switzerland. As a research system, Polypheny-DB is not intended to be used in a productive environment.


## Getting Started ##
The easiest way to setup Polypheny-DB is to use [Polypheny Control](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-Control). 


## Roadmap ##
See the [open issues](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-DB/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).


## Credits ##
_Polypheny-DB_ builds upon the great work of several other projects:

* [Apache Avatica](https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/): A framework for building database drivers
* [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/): A framework for building databases
* [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/): Relational database written in Java
* [JavaCC](https://javacc.org/): A parser generator
* [Java Spark](http://sparkjava.com/): A framework for building web services
* [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): A library which provides annotations for tedious tasks
